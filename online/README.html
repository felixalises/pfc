The purpose of this virtual machine is to let you test the deployment
fully described here: http<a>://testbed.casafx.dyndns.org/pfc/DOCUMENTOS/
(only Spanish, automatic traslation <a href="http://translate.google.es/translate?hl=es&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Frawgithub.com%2Ffelixalises%2Fpfc%2Fmaster%2Fpfc%2Findex.html&sandbox=1">here</a>).
</p>
<p>
It was created by me, Félix Alises-Casas, and in its final stage I
decided to reorient it as my Final Year Proyect in order to complete
my Bachelor in Telematics. Hence, the extensive documentation in
Spanish.

  The original documentation is more than 800 pages. So, it is summarized here
  in less than 2000 lines distributed in small files and using different
  resources (ttyrec videos, flowcharts, diagrams). The goal is to offer you
  several entry points to my comments as well as a moderate rich reading
  experience.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of this text is a general overview of the platform and a "What to do
  next" epilogue to this README document.

  I will use authoring plural during my exposure.

<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> General overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>  The ultimate aim is to deploy a telematic infrastructure that offers usual
  services (VoIP, mail, shell&hellip;) to its users, and that employs specialized
  technologies (LDAP, KERBEROS, AFS, NTP&hellip;) to deal in a distributed way with
  all the metadata those services depend on. Therefore, it is a telematic
  infrastructure as those found in well known USA digital university campuses,
  research centers or other organizations that have the need to autoprovide
  themselves with their communication services in a large and scalable way.
</p>
<p>
  Specifying a bit more, and in line with what we have mentioned, we can
  analyze our infraestructure as compounded by two main layers of services:
  base services and, on top of that, end-user services. Base layer offers
  services to end-user layer, and end-user layer offers services to end-users,
  to the people of our organization. Let us focus on each layer:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>End-user services layer</b>. We tried to support the fundamental types of services:
    synchronous person-person (IM and VoIP), asynchronous person-person
    (mail services), generic person-system (POSIX shell, see later).
<ul>
<li>A fundamental design of the deployment of this layer is that in/out to
      the corresponding servers is beneficiated by a distributed deployment. So
      both, dklab1 and dklab2 run an instance of each server and are properly
      configured to let users registered in one instance to communicate with
      those registered in other, etc.  The client part is also installed and
      configured in dklab1 and dklab2, see later for indications to log-in
      using a centralized account and, thanks to it, to test the services using
      the installed client implementations.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><b>Base services layer</b>. The former servers and its clients make use of
    a layer of specialized servers to deal with metadata. Making the story
    short:

<p>
    DNS service and its SRV records provides a mechanism to discover the
    services. NTP provides a consistent time source for databases replication
    mechanisms, kerberos tickets expiration date etc. KERBEROS provides the
    authentication subservice for all the protocols except DNS and
    NTP. Specific metadata of each service (account information, subscriptions,
    mail redirection&hellip; also kerberos keys) are stored under an LDAP directory,
    except volatile data (such as IM presence state) that uses an SQL
    database. AFS is the distributed file system that offers an ubiquitous home
    directory for end-users as well as file storage for servers, if needed.
</p><ul>
<li>Therefore, we have an SQL, LDAP, DNS&hellip; server instance in dklab1 where
      the rest of the systems resolve metadata. However, that way dklab1 could
      constitute a single point of failure and, as a solution for this, the
      in/out to them is distributed thanks to redundant instances in
      dklab2. That introduces a problem of consistency and coherence in our
      data model, so automatic replication mechanisms are used. Whenever
      possible, the scheme used is synchronous multi-master replication, but
      not always (DNS for example uses the classic master-slave scheme in our
      deployment). Thanks to the DBMS's components, redundancies and
      replication mechanisms the data model of our services is properly
      centralized and, as a result, easy to manage and scale.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><b>Missing layer</b>. We can miss a third, control layer ensuring conditions
    such as high availability or high performance. Although we are
    familiarized with corosync/pacemaker or linux virtual server, they are not
    included in this specific deployment (if interested, you can take a look
    to our notes and key deployments guides about them in a more informal
    style - and only spanish - here: <a href="http://testbed.casafx.dyndns.org/tmp/HighAvailability.html">HA</a>, <a href="http://testbed.casafx.dyndns.org/tmp/HighPerformance.html">HP</a>). It is worth to mention that,
    nonetheless, some of our chosen implementations provide built-in
    clustering services by thir own (notably OpenAFS).
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> How it works</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">


<p>
  So, how it works?
</p>
<p>
  An <b>user</b> choses a computer, no matter which one, and completes a log-in
  secuence giving a username and a password. Both are used by the log-in
  process to get a KERBEROS ticket. Automatically this ticket is used to get an
  AFS token and, finally, the OS shell is provided to the user and working
  directory is set to his home in AFS.
</p>
<p>
  From then, this user can open a mail MUA software and check an IMAP account,
  send new emails or manage sieve filters. He or she can also open an instant
  messaging/VoIP software which, in a second, receives from the server an
  automatically generated (from LDAP) roster including current people of the
  organization grouped by some criteria.
</p>
<p>
  Those communications are authenticated without any extra prompt to the user
  thanks to KERBEROS Single Sign On solution. SASL-GSSAPI authentication
  subprotocol or TLS presentation subprotocol provide an encryption layer
  and, for that reason, integrity and confidential services.
</p>
<p>
  The user can use all the authorized resources of the computer (other software
  installed etc) and, if to have better hardware available results to be
  necessary, the user can move to that better computer or initiates an ssh
  remote session in situ. In both cases, the environment remains
  the same thanks to the use of an LDAP centralized account and AFS home
  directory.
</p>

<p>  
  From the point of view of the <b>administrator</b>, after deploying all the
  infrastructure described here etc, the inclusion of a new user is as
  simple as running a script that, in essence, creates the relevant entries
  and resources in LDAP, KERBEROS and AFS. After that the account is usable
  from any computer, and the new user is subscribed to the rest of the
  people, newsletter mails etc.
</p>
<p>
  If a new computer is bought for users (not as a server), the administrator
  has to just modify the log-in process to point to the base servers (LDAP,
  KERBEROS, AFS&hellip;), making the centralized accounts available.
</p>
<p>
  If the organization grows, new servers have to be added. Thanks to the
  DNS SRV service discovering and the replication technics used, the
  addition of new servers is very independent of the rest, and should not
  impose new problems or a great overhead.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> What to do next</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>As you know, the deployment is compound by the minimum number of needed
machines, two: dklab1 (where you are), and dklab2. You can use 'ssh' to move
from one to the other, just command:
</p>


<pre class="src src-sh">ssh dklab2   <span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">As known: username = password = root</span>
</pre>


<p>
But, please, be aware that, for now, you would prefer to do these three types
of things:
</p><ul>
<li>Continue reading.
</li>
<li>Watch demostrative ttyrec videos.
</li>
<li>Take those videos as an example of commands to run.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
To continue reading, you can press 'q' to exit this file and run "Relevant"
command. It lists relevant files to read and ttyplay. We suggest you start
reading <a href="./ADMIN/README.admin.html">ADMIN/README.admin</a>, which unfolds the deployment details. Then, you can
read <a href="./USER/README.user.html">USER/README.user</a> which points you to an overview of the final present
features of each end-user service. Additionally, each of those documents of
features give you instructions to watch a ttyrec demonstration as well as a
transcription of it. This way you can have a source of interesting commands to
imitate in order to play and inspect the deployment by yourself.
</p>



<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">What to do next:</span>
 Relevant
 w3m ADMIN/README.admin.html
 w3m USER/README.user.html
 ttyplay USER/TTYREC/shell.ttyrec
</pre>


<p>
Both, dklab1 and dklab2, are run by qemu in snapshot mode. Any changes you make
will not last really long.
