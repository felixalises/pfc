<p><i>POSIX SHELL</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Generic person-system service implementation. Features:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Users can completely use computer resources thanks to a Shell interface.
</li>
<li>
Homogeneous use of any computer: same password, same home, same documents,
same software.
</li>
<li>
Under this, user has always the possibility of switching from a machine to
other looking for gretater computing power or other hardware characteristic.
</li>
<li>
A successfull log-in process prepares SSO (Single Sign On) availability
later.

<p>
We fully deployed this on Debian GNU/Linux, so we installed and configured
specific  components of its NSS and PAM subsystems. As a result, the log-in
process let centralized accounts be used:
</p><ul>
<li>
NSS subsystem can query all the necessary metadata to LDAP.
</li>
<li>
PAM, by its own and helped by NSS, can get Kerberos TGT ticket after
successfully challenging KERBEROS AS (Authentication Server), ensuring
SSO (Single Sign On) later:
</li>
<li>
Thanks to Kerberos TGT ticket, PAM can also get a service ticket for AFS,
allowing shell to place the user in its ubiquitous home directory
under /afs.
</li>
<li>
Evidently, DNS was properly set up pointing to our servers in order to
let the rest of the services to discover each other.

</li>
</ul>

<p>The third feature (switching to other machine) can be used in situ through
SSH (service which is also deployed and takes advantage of SSO). Additional
possibilities such as X forwarding and sound output network redirection were
also explored.
</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>There is a ttyrec video (15 minutes). Please, run:

                 POSIX SHELL SERVICE DEMOSTRATION



&#172;

                   ( Useful  ttyplay  keybindings:

                     &lt;space&gt;    jump to next event, do not wait!
                     0,1        pause or set 1x speed.
                     Control-c  exit.
                   )


<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">At this initial point, we are root and our current directory is /root,
</span>  we can check it:

whoami
<span style="color: #b0c4de;">pwd</span>

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">...we are going to change that.
</span>
clear

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Our purpouse is to log-in using a centralized account such as "umea", and to
</span>  check how this log-in process 1) gets KERBEROS and AFS credentials, 2)
  gets user metadata from LDAP and 0) discovers all those services querying
  SRV DNS registries.

  We use <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"login"</span>, a log-in program interfaced with our already configured PAM
  and NSS subsystems. They, PAM and NSS, are the real responsables for the
  discovery and connection with Kerberos, AFS and LDAP subsystems (the steps we
  have mentioned<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> the former paragraph) on behalf of us.

  So, since those connections are stablished thanks to DNS SRV registries, we
  can start checking that they are<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> place. First we look for the DNS
  resolvers, then we use <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"dig"</span> utility to query for SRV registries:

cat /etc/resolv.conf

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">So we have more than one resolver; we can choose, for example, DNS resolver at
</span>  10.168.1.1 passing it to dig this way: <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"dig @10.168.1.1 &lt;query&gt;"</span> Therefore:

  Using <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"dig"</span> and SRV registries for discovering LDAP servers:

dig @10.168.1.1 _ldap._tcp.casafx.dyndns.org SRV +short

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Using "dig" and SRV registries for discovering Kerberos servers:
</span>
dig @10.168.1.1 _kerberos._udp.casafx.dyndns.org SRV +short

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Using "dig" and SRV registries for discovering AFS servers:
</span>
dig @10.168.1.1 _afs3-prserver._udp.casafx.dyndns.org SRV +short
dig @10.168.1.1 _afs3-vlserver._udp.casafx.dyndns.org SRV +short

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">As a conclusion, all our servers can be discovered and are located
</span>  both,<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> dklab1 and dklab2.

clear

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Let us now concentrate in one of the processes, the retrieving of account
</span>  metadata from LDAP. As we mentioned, NSS subsystem is responsable to do that
  on behalf of us.

  A way of testing that all is well configured and NSS can reach specifically
  umea metadata stored<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> LDAP is using a program which interfaces NSS. One
  possibility is the <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"id"</span> program. It can look for metadata such as uid and gid
  numbers:

id umea

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">... which means that umea is identified by 31000 number and the same goes
</span>  <span style="color: #00ffff;">for</span> its group.

  What NSS actually does to find out them is an LDAP query to a certain node.

  We can represent our directory information tree<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> LDAP as a trunk called
  <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"dc=casafx,dc=dyndns,dc=org"</span>, parent of a branch called <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"accounts"</span>, parent of
  a <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"subbranch"</span> called <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"users"</span> and, finally the leaf node for umea which stores
  attributes such as uidNumber, gidNumber, homeDirectory, loginShell, etc. See
  this diagram:

  DIT <span style="color: #eedd82;">dc</span>=casafx, <span style="color: #eedd82;">dc</span>=dyndns, <span style="color: #eedd82;">dc</span>=org
      &#9500;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472; <span style="color: #eedd82;">ou</span>=accounts
      ...                            &#9500;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472; <span style="color: #eedd82;">ou</span>=users
                                     &#9474;               &#9500;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472; <span style="color: #eedd82;">uid</span>=umea
                                     ...             ...

  This way, the LDAP query made by NSS should be something like this one:

ldapsearch -LLL -Q                                                       <span style="color: #ffa07a;">\</span>
         -b <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"uid=umea,ou=users,ou=accounts,dc=casafx,dc=dyndns,dc=org"</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">\</span>
         homeDirectory uidNumber gidNumber loginShell

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">As you can see, we get the same numbers we got before with "id" program and
</span>  NSS, but this time directly querying the source, emulating NSS behaviour. We
  have also asked for loginShell and homeDirectory as NSS will do during log-in
  process. The value recieved for homeDirectory let us think that umea home
  directory is located on AFS:

  /afs/casafx.dyndns.org/user/u/um/umea

clear

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">We have explored LDAP metadata retrieving. The other two main subprocesses of
</span>  centralized log-in were Kerberos and AFS authentication.

  About this, we could manually run <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"kinit"</span> program, which asks us for a
  password, then it send that password to Kerberos AS server which,<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> turn and
  <span style="color: #00ffff;">if</span> correct, issue a TGT ticket that <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"kinit"</span> stores<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> a local credential
  cache.

  Then, we could run <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"aklog"</span> command, it uses last TGT ticket to get an ST
  ticket for AFS; this service ticket is used to authenticate against AFS PS
  server to transparently get an AFS token, credential which let us manipulate
  our home directory<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> AFS.

  The fact that after an initial authentication (against Kerberos AS, getting a
  TGT credential) the subsequent ones happen automatically and without
  disturbing the user asking for another password is called SSO (Single Sign
  On)<span style="color: #b0c4de;">.</span> It is a very desirable feature of a Kerberos deployment when all the
  services (not only AFS) are prepared to use it. It is our case, by the way.

  Anyway, it is not necessary to illustrate this any further explicitly running
  <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"kinit"</span> and <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"aklog"</span> programs as we did for ldapsearch while talking about
  LDAP retrieving. The intesting thing is to check if those authentications we
  have been talking about are taken automatically by PAM libraries and, so,
  login program and log-in process. We have to add that, of course, a success
  <span style="color: #00ffff;">in</span> Kerberos AS authentication implies a success<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> log-in authentication.

  So, it is time we log-in as umea using <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"login"</span> program:

clear
login umea

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">( password was "umeapa55" without quotes )
</span>
  Now, we can ask who are we now: we were root, but after log-in we are umea:
whoami

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">We can check that our current shell is what was indicated in LDAP: /bin/bash
</span><span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> $<span style="color: #eedd82;">SHELL</span>

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">We can also check that our current directoy has changed to that one, as we
</span>  saw, on our AFS cell: /afs/casafx.dyndns.org/user/u/um/umea/

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">pwd</span>
ls


<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">The fact that we can use 'ls' on AFS can only be because during log-in we
</span>  got, automatically as we promised, proper credentials. It is time to list
  those credentials from their cache.

  We use <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"klist"</span> to list Kerberos credentials. Two lines with something like
  <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"krbtgt/..."</span> and <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"afs/..."</span> appears. As we can figure out, they correspond
  to the TGT and AFS ST tickets, respectively, we talked about.

klist | grep -E <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'(krbtgt|afs)'</span>

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Here they are. We can also see our AFS token, the AFS specific credential,
</span>  with <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"tokens"</span> command:

tokens | grep afs
clear

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Credentials in place, we can test the effect of changing computer in
</span>  situ using SSH. This is a very interesting aspect of our infraestructure:

  - Specifically, this let us<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> situ use the maybe superior resources of
    another machine, but without altering our context: keeping our identity,
    home directory and its files, programs even.

  - And second, SSH authentication happens transparently, without any
    disturbing, thanks to Kerberos SSO.


  So, being our current host dklab1:
hostname --fqdn

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Let us conmute to dklab2 using SSH:
</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">###</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">ssh  -o "GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes" -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" dklab2
</span>ssh  -o <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes"</span> dklab2

hostname --fqdn

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">So it was dklab1, and now is dklab2 as expected. Although we are using
</span>  other physical resources, all remains the same. We can check it:

  Same home directory and its contents respect to what we see while<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> dklab1:

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">pwd</span>
ls

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Even the same programs are there if administrator decides something like
</span>  that. For example, our shell interpreter or <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"klist"</span> command are available
  as it happened while<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> dklab1:

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> $<span style="color: #eedd82;">SHELL</span>
which klist

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">The other key aspect of our SSH login was that SSO is used: "ssh" command
</span>  did not prompt for a password during log-in. We can see the corresponding
  Kerberos ST (service ticket) <span style="color: #00ffff;">for</span> SSH acquired to achieve this (by the way, it
  is not necessary to get another credential, that <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"token"</span> was just an AFS
  specific thing)<span style="color: #b0c4de;">.</span> To check that we have to first return to dklab1.

  But before it is worth to mention that our initial credential (TGT ticket we
  got during initial log-in) was copied from dklab1 to dklab2, making it
  available now, making SSO possible for hypothetical future authentications.

  ... former credential copied from dklab1 to dklab2:

klist


<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">And now yes, after showing this copy aspect, we wanted to return to dklab1
</span>  and show Kerberos ST ticket that let us make SSO during SSH:

<span style="color: #00ffff;">exit</span>
klist  | grep host/dklab2

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Here it is Kerberos ST ticket for SSH.
</span>
<span style="color: #00ffff;">exit</span>
<span style="color: #00ffff;">exit</span>
clear

<span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Until this, we have explored how log-in sets up a useful environment to use
</span>  our computer resources, wherever they are. Next action is to run programs,
  such as clients of other services of our telematic infrastructure. About
  this, you can play the rest of ttyrec videos as a way of demonstration.


  F&#233;lix.
